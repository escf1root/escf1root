## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##### About Me

I'm escf1root â€” a curious web pentester, security explorer, and digital faultfinder.  
Rooted in logic, driven by curiosity, I analyze web applications from the inside out, identifying flaws that most overlook.  
My goal is to learn deeply, break silently, and help systems become more resilient â€” one exploit at a time.

> I don't rely on tools â€” I study how they think.
